/// {@template bloc}
/// ## Business Logic Component (BLoC)
///
/// A [StatefulWidget] has built-in logic: it can react to user input
/// to change the state of the UI.
///
/// A "Business Logic Component" is code that just handles logic
/// without any direct connection to the UI.
///
/// Stateful widgets are great for lots things, but if you had a stateful widget
/// with a "dark mode" switch, it would only change the theme for that screen,
/// not across the whole app. Flutter tries to be efficient and only rebuild a widget
/// when needed, so you could store the theme mode in a global variable that every widget
/// can access, and it still wouldn't update the other screens right awayâ€”the theme would
/// abruptly change when something else causes other widgets to rebuild.
///
/// Instead of using [State.setState] to update a value, you can use a [BlocProvider],
/// and it'll send a stream of data to any widget that needs it.
/// {@endtemplate}
///
/// The Heart Center is implementing BLoCs using the `provider` package
/// and the [Cubit] class in this file.
