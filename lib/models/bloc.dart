/// ## Business Logic Component (BLoC)
///
/// A [StatefulWidget] has built-in logic: it can react to user input
/// to change the state of the UI.
///
/// A "Business Logic Component" is code that just handles logic
/// without any direct connection to the UI.
///
/// Stateful widgets are great for lots things, but if you had a stateful widget
/// with a "dark mode" switch, it would only change the theme for that screen,
/// not across the whole app. Flutter tries to be efficient and only rebuild a widget
/// when needed, so you could store the theme mode in a global variable that every widget
/// can access, and it still wouldn't update the other screens right awayâ€”the theme would
/// abruptly change when something else causes other widgets to rebuild.
///
/// Instead of using [State.setState] to update a value, you can use a [Bloc] for state
/// management, and it'll send a stream of data to any widget that needs it.
///
/// The Heart Center is implementing BLoCs using `provider`,
/// along with some classes borrowed from `flutter_bloc`.
///
/// `provider` is a dependency in our pubspec.yaml, and the extra BLoC classes are in this file!

/// This class is a "building bloc" used to define other classes in `bloc.dart`.
///
/// The right BLoC to use depends on the situation:
/// - [Cubit] for immutable types
/// - [Claybit] for mutable types
/// - [CustomBloc] for the most flexibility

  /// BLoCs need a way to emit changes into a widget's build context;

///
/// ```dart
/// int, double, bool, String // immutable types
/// List, Map, Set            // mutable types
/// ```
/// Immutable types (usually) won't change unless they're reassigned.
///
/// But other types can "mutate" even if they're declared as `final`.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```dart
/// String string = 'cat';
/// string[0] = 'f'; // error, can't change parts of a String
///
/// // reassigning the whole string works, since it isn't final
/// string = 'f${string.substring(1)}'; // string is 'fat' now
///
/// final List list = [1, 2, 3];
/// list[0] = 5; // works fine
/// ```
